    <p><b>Welcome to Wilderness Trails!</b></p>
    <p>This page has some information that may be helpful to you in your neighborhood.  We are glad you chose to move into our community!</p>
    <p>Wilderness Trails is as great a community as each property owner makes it;  paying fees when due and maintaining property well is beneficial to us all.</p>
    <p>Our neighborhood is maintained by homeowners;  the annual assessments cover maintenance of our roads inside the subdivision.  Snow removal and salting, mowing of some common areas and trash/recycling pickup are not included in the annual assessment.  These variable costs are divided among homeowners and billed quarterly.</p>
    <p>You are welcome to contact board members about concerns or question.  And you are welcome to serve on the board of directors in the future.</p>
    <p>Please contact the board at:  <a href="mailto:WildernessTrailsHOA@gmail.com">WildernessTrailsHOA@gmail.com</a></p>
    <p>Payments should be mailed to:<br />
